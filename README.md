This project is part of my learning journey in full-stack development. I created it to explore and understand the interaction between frontend and backend technologies, using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. The frontend is structured with components, state management, and routing, while the backend handles API requests, data processing, and serves content using RESTful endpoints.


NOTE : TO RUN THIS PROJECT YOU NEED TO CREATE a .env file that contains the API key to MongoDB.
The project is organized with separate folders for the frontend and backend, each with its own configuration files (e.g., package.json) to simulate a real-world development environment. I used MongoDB as the database to manage data storage, and the entire application follows a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) architecture.
